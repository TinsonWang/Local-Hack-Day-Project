Once upon a time, there was a fucking first year undergraduate who wanted to learn how to code.
He thought coding was going to be easy. What a goddamn idiot though.
This bitch attended all of the GCC events even though he was a really shit coder.
One day, he became really frustrated with his code. To that, he shouted in rage:
"Why won't this fucking fuck fuck damn dick fuck horny dog-fucker work?!"
He ended up exploding in a fit of rage and he never recovered.
To this day, first year undergraduate students fear losing their sanity as their fellow comrade once has.
